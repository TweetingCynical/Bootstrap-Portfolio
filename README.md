### Deployment / Code Repository

[Live deployment](https://tweetingcynical.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/)

[Repository](https://github.com/TweetingCynical/Bootstrap-Portfolio)

### Scope and Purpose

Re-build the professional portfolio page for showcasing work on web development projects, using Bootstrap components and layouts.

### Wireframe

The initial layout design created for the work display grid was envisioned using good old pencil and paper technology, favoured by live, in-person teamworking. Here is one one of the iterations that eventually led to the design you see on the live site today:

### Overview of Build

This page has been built to showcase some of the following skills in use in the HTML and CSS:
- Bootstrap 4.3.1 css linked to index.html for controlling style;
- @import to use fonts stored with google apis;
- :root to store colour overrides and font for sitewide use;
- Creation of nav bar, nav links and responsive settings using Bootstrap;
- Creation of a side nav bar with hover effect on buttons, fixed to the left side and no scrolling;
- Use of jumbotron for page hero;
- Animation effect on the h2 Hello, World! title to look like typewriter;
- Use of Boostrap's flex grid system for the main content;
- Creation of key overrides for use of personalised colours, borders, margins and padding;
- Use of Boostrap classes for customising styles, such as rounded-circle to create a circular image;
- Transition effect to nav bar logo, images and a tags;
- Linear gradients used on header and work display images using stored colours;
- Override styling of different classes within the grid to allow for easier addition of future grid rows;
- Use of Bootstrap badge tags for overlaying of headlines onto images;
- Use of Bootstrap spinners for added effect in skills section;
- Use of Bootstrap progress bars for skills learned and expected learning;
- Hover options to add an outline border and remove linear gradients to draw focus to images;
- Media queries override to manage edge cases and to adjust for sizes of viewport not managed by Boostrap's responsiveness.
- Combine like attribute values to streamline CSS code;
- Use of html semantics where possible.


## Suggested future changes

- Add further portfolio elements to replace placeholders;
- Create links to professional pages on LinkedIn, Figma etc;
- Add unfolding options for items within grid so default is to show latest/best 4 items, but a button will reveal an expanded grid with others below;
- Consider full redesign to add CTA's and user funnels to make page more attractive for CTA than simple information.
